## Featured Projects
### [YorkU Course Availability Notifier](https://github.com/gurkarangill07/YorkU-Course-Availability-Notifier)
Built a YorkU course-seat monitoring system that parses VSB `getClassData.jsp` payloads and detects seat openings (`os > 0`) in near real time.
Implemented an Express API + single-page UI for email-based course tracking, PostgreSQL-backed persistence (`users`, `courses`, `user_courses`), and Playwright session automation with re-login handling.

### [LE-EECS1012-FINAL-PROJECT](https://github.com/gurkarangill07/LE-EECS1012-FINAL-PROJECT)
Contributed to a dental office management system by building patient registration/scheduling flows and full CRUD operations for patient records.
Worked on validation-driven form handling, calendar-based views, and Node.js backend integration for reliable data updates across the UI.

### [AI-Posture-Corrector-and-Analyzer](https://github.com/OmidRahmanian/AI-Posture-Corrector-and-Analyzer)
Contributed directly in the main repository to a TypeScript + Python posture analysis product focused on identifying posture issues and delivering corrective guidance.
Collaborated through active commit and pull-request workflows to improve core application functionality.
